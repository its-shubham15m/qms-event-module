## üöÄ How to Run and Use the Project

### Step 1: Setup and Run the Application

#### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* Node.js 18+ and npm
* A Google Gemini API Key

#### Backend Setup
1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:** `cd backend`
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * On Windows: `python -m venv venv` followed by `venv\Scripts\activate`
    * On macOS/Linux: `python3 -m venv venv` followed by `source venv/bin/activate`
3.  **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `backend` directory and add your API key: `GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"`
5.  **Run the FastAPI server:** `uvicorn main:app --reload`
    * The backend will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Frontend Setup
1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:** `cd frontend`
2.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3.  **Run the Vite development server:** `npm run dev`
    * The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Step 2: Using the Application
1.  **Create a New Audit:** Open `http://localhost:5173`, click **"Schedule New Audit"**, and fill out the 5-step wizard.
2.  **View and Sort Audits:** Your new audit will appear in the table. Click on table headers like "Audit ID" or "Title" to sort the data.
3.  **Interact with the AI Assistant:** Use the suggestion buttons or type your own questions in the right-hand panel.

## ü§ñ Detailed AI Assistant Capabilities

The AI assistant uses Google Gemini's function-calling feature to provide accurate, tool-based responses. This is more reliable than simple text generation as it forces the AI to use a predefined set of capabilities.

### Implemented AI Tools & Usage:

* **`Identify Trends`**: Analyzes the entire dataset to provide high-level insights on audit distribution and resource allocation.
    * **Usage:** Click the "Identify Trends" prompt or type `"show me trends"`.

* **`Filter by Status`**: Allows users to quickly segment the audit list to focus on specific stages of the QMS lifecycle.
    * **Usage:** Click the "Filter by 'Planned'" prompt or type `"show me all closed events"`.

* **`Summarize Single Audit`**: Provides a quick, detailed summary of a specific audit on demand.
    * **Usage:** Click the "Summarize by ID" prompt and enter an ID, or type `"summarize event 2"`.

* **`List Personnel`**: Quickly retrieves all stakeholders for a specific audit, improving communication.
    * **Usage:** Click the "List Personnel by ID" prompt and enter an ID, or type `"who is on the team for audit 1?"`.

* **`Suggest Next Steps`**: Provides actionable, context-aware recommendations for a specific audit, helping guide users through the process.
    * **Usage:** Type `"what are the next steps for audit 2?"`.

* **`Suggest Root Cause`**: Leverages the AI's reasoning to suggest potential root causes for an audit finding, accelerating the investigation phase.
    * **Usage:** Type `"suggest root cause for audit 1"`.

* **`Find Similar Events`**: Helps identify recurring issues by finding historical audits with similar scopes or titles.
    * **Usage:** Type `"find events similar to event 1"`.

* **`Draft Kick-off Email`**: Automates a common administrative task, saving time and ensuring professional, consistent communication.
    * **Usage:** Click the "Draft Kick-off by ID" prompt and enter an ID, or type `"draft an email for audit 2"`.

## üìù Discussion Points

### Understanding of QMS & Design Rationale

A Quality Management System in Life Sciences is crucial for ensuring product quality, patient safety, and regulatory compliance. The design of this application was guided by the core QMS principles of **traceability, data integrity, and risk management**.

* **Structured Audit ID (`AUD-INT-001`):** This feature directly supports **traceability**. The unique, predictable ID format allows any event to be instantly classified and tracked throughout its lifecycle, which is a fundamental requirement for regulatory bodies like the FDA.

* **Wizard-Style Event Creation:** This design choice enhances **data integrity**. By guiding the user through a required set of steps, it minimizes the risk of incomplete or erroneous data entry, ensuring that every record is compliant from the moment of creation.

* **AI as a Decision-Support Tool:** The AI assistant promotes proactive **risk management and efficiency**. Tools like `Suggest Root Cause` and `Find Similar Events` empower quality professionals to analyze potential issues faster and identify recurring problems, moving from a reactive to a proactive quality culture.

### Architecture and Technology Choices

* **FastAPI (Backend):** Chosen for its high performance and automatic data validation through Pydantic type hints. This enforces a strict schema for incoming data, which is critical for maintaining data integrity in a regulated system.
* **React with Vite (Frontend):** React's component-based architecture is ideal for building a complex and maintainable UI like the wizard. Vite was selected for its superior developer experience and fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
* **Redux Toolkit (State Management):** Used to manage a centralized, single source of truth for application state (like the event list and AI conversation). This prevents data inconsistencies and simplifies the data flow.
* **SQLModel (Database Interaction):** Selected to reduce code duplication by combining the API's data validation schema and the database's table schema into a single class, enforcing consistency between the API and the database.

### Challenges Faced

* **AI Tool Integration:** A recurring `500 Internal Server Error` was traced to a `TypeError` within the Gemini library. The root cause was that the library's function-calling mechanism could not automatically serialize complex custom objects from our database. The solution was to refactor the AI tools to only accept simple data types (like `string` and `int`) and then manually inject the database context within the backend logic. This made the integration robust and reliable.
* **UI Fidelity:** Ensuring the React components were a pixel-perfect match to the static HTML mockups required careful migration of custom CSS classes and precise application of Tailwind utilities, especially for the multi-step wizard indicator. This was solved by creating a definitive `index.css` file that directly mirrored the styles from the source mockups.

### Future Improvements

* **Backend Filtering/Sorting:** The current implementation uses client-side filtering and sorting. For larger datasets, this should be moved to the backend with API endpoints that accept sort and filter parameters (e.g., `/api/events?sort_by=title&status=planned`) to improve performance.
* **Authentication:** Implement user authentication (e.g., using JWT) to secure the application, create audit trails of user actions, and associate events with specific owners.
* **Detail Page:** Build the "Event Detail Page" that was out of scope for this task, allowing users to click on an audit in the list to see and edit its full details.
